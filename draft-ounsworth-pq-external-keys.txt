          External Keys And Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                 draft-ounsworth-pq-external-pubkeys-00

Abstract

   Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have either large
   public keys or signatures.  In the interest of reducing bandwidth of
   transitting X.509 certificates, this document provides a mechanism
   for referencing external public key and signature data by hash, URL,
   etc.
